        "The second is PHEME dataset BIBREF48. It provides 2,402 conversations covering nine events. Following previous work, we conduct leave-one-event-out cross-validation: in each fold, one event's conversations are used for testing, and all the rest events are used for training. The evaluation metric on this dataset is computed after integrating the outputs of all nine folds. Note that only a subset of this dataset has stance labels, and all conversations in this subset are already contained in SemEval-2017 task 8 dataset. Thus, PHEME dataset is used to evaluate veracity prediction task."
