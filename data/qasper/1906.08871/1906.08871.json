        "We built two types of simultaneous speech EEG recording databases for this work. For database A five female and five male subjects took part in the experiment. For database B five male and three female subjects took part in the experiment. Except two subjects, rest all were native English speakers for both the databases. All subjects were UT Austin undergraduate,graduate students in their early twenties."

        "We built two types of simultaneous speech EEG recording databases for this work. For database A five female and five male subjects took part in the experiment. For database B five male and three female subjects took part in the experiment. Except two subjects, rest all were native English speakers for both the databases. All subjects were UT Austin undergraduate,graduate students in their early twenties.",
        "For data set A, the 10 subjects were asked to speak the first 30 sentences from the USC-TIMIT database BIBREF16 and their simultaneous speech and EEG signals were recorded. This data was recorded in presence of background noise of 40 dB (noise generated by room air conditioner fan). We then asked each subject to repeat the same experiment two more times, thus we had 30 speech EEG recording examples for each sentence.",
        "For data set B, the 8 subjects were asked to repeat the same previous experiment but this time we used background music played from our lab computer to generate a background noise of 65 dB. Here we had 24 speech EEG recording examples for each sentence."
