        "In order to eliminate the need to find data and build separate models for each language, we propose a multilingual approach where a single model is built in the language where the largest resources are available. In this paper we focus on English as there are several sentiment analysis datasets in English. To make the English sentiment analysis model as generalizable as possible, we first start by training with a large dataset that has product reviews for different categories. Then, using the trained weights from the larger generic dataset, we make the model more specialized for a specific domain. We further train the model with domain-specific English reviews and use this trained model to score reviews that share the same domain from different languages. To be able to employ the trained model, test sets are first translated to English via machine translation and then inference takes place. Figure FIGREF1 shows our multilingual sentiment analysis approach. It is important to note that this approach does not utilize any resource in any of the languages of the test sets (e.g., word embeddings, lexicons, training set).",
