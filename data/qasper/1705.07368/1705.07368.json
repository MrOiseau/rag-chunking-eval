        "Word embeddings have risen in popularity for NLP applications due to the success of models designed specifically for the big data setting. In particular, BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 showed that very simple word embedding models with high-dimensional representations can scale up to massive datasets, allowing them to outperform more sophisticated neural network language models which can process fewer documents. In this work, I offer a somewhat contrarian perspective to the currently prevailing trend of big data optimism, as exemplified by the work of BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF3 , and others, who argue that massive datasets are sufficient to allow language models to automatically resolve many challenging NLP tasks. Note that \u201cbig\u201d datasets are not always available, particularly in computational social science NLP applications, where the data of interest are often not obtained from large scale sources such as the internet and social media, but from sources such as press releases BIBREF11 , academic journals BIBREF10 , books BIBREF12 , and transcripts of recorded speech BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 . A standard practice in the literature is to train word embedding models on a generic large corpus such as Wikipedia, and use the embeddings for NLP tasks on the target dataset, cf. BIBREF3 , BIBREF0 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 . However, as we shall see here, this standard practice might not always be effective, as the size of a dataset does not correspond to its degree of relevance for a particular analysis. Even very large corpora have idiosyncrasies that can make their embeddings invalid for other domains. For instance, suppose we would like to use word embeddings to analyze scientific articles on machine learning. In Table TABREF1 , I report the most similar words to the word \u201clearning\u201d based on word embedding models trained on two corpora. For embeddings trained on articles from the NIPS conference, the most similar words are related to machine learning, as desired, while for embeddings trained on the massive, generic Google News corpus, the most similar words relate to learning and teaching in the classroom. Evidently, domain-specific data can be important.",
        "I have proposed a model-based method for training interpretable corpus-specific word embeddings for computational social science, using mixed membership representations, Metropolis-Hastings-Walker sampling, and NCE. Experimental results for prediction, supervised learning, and case studies on state of the Union addresses and NIPS articles, indicate that high-quality embeddings and topics can be obtained using the method. The results highlight the fact that big data is not always best, as domain-specific data can be very valuable, even when it is small. I plan to use this approach for substantive social science applications, and to address algorithmic bias and fairness issues."

        "I also performed several case studies. I obtained document embeddings, in the same latent space as the topic embeddings, by summing the posterior mean vectors INLINEFORM0 for each token, and visualized them in two dimensions using INLINEFORM1 -SNE BIBREF24 (all vectors were normalized to unit length). The state of the Union addresses (Figure FIGREF27 ) are embedded almost linearly by year, with a major jump around the New Deal (1930s), and are well separated by party at any given time period. The embedded topics (gray) allow us to interpret the space. The George W. Bush addresses are embedded near a \u201cwar on terror\u201d topic (\u201cweapons, war...\u201d), and the Barack Obama addresses are embedded near a \u201cstimulus\u201d topic (\u201cpeople, work...\u201d)."
