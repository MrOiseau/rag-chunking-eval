      "question": "What TIMIT datasets are used for testing?",

        "In order to achieve these configuration the TIMIT data was split. Fig. FIGREF12 illustrates the split of the data into 8 subsets (A\u2013H). The TIMIT dataset contains speech from 462 speakers in training and 168 speakers in the test set, with 8 utterances for each speaker. The TIMIT training and test set are split into 8 blocks, where each block contains 2 utterances per speaker, randomly chosen. Thus each block A,B,C,D contains data from 462 speakers with 924 utterances taken from the training sets, and each block E,F,G,H contains speech from 168 test set speakers with 336 utterances.",
        "For Task a training of embeddings and the classifier is identical, namely consisting of data from blocks (A+B+C+E+F+G). The test data is the remainder, namely blocks (D+H). For Task b the training of embeddings and classifiers uses (A+B+E+F) and (C+G) respectively, while again using (D+H) for test. Task c keeps both separate: embeddings are trained on (A+B+C+D), classifiers on (E+G) and tests are conducted on (F+H). Note that H is part of all tasks, and that Task c is considerably easier as the number of speakers to separate is only 168, although training conditions are more difficult."
