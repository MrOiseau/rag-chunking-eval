# Towards Multimodal Emotion Recognition in German Speech Events in Cars using Transfer Learning

## Abstract
The recognition of emotions by humans is a complex process which considers multiple interacting signals such as facial expressions and both prosody and semantic content of utterances. Commonly, research on automatic recognition of emotions is, with few exceptions, limited to one modality. We describe an in-car experiment for emotion recognition from speech interactions for three modalities: the audio signal of a spoken interaction, the visual signal of the driver's face, and the manually transcribed content of utterances of the driver. We use off-the-shelf tools for emotion detection in audio and face and compare that to a neural transfer learning approach for emotion recognition from text which utilizes existing resources from other domains. We see that transfer learning enables models based on out-of-domain corpora to perform well. This method contributes up to 10 percentage points in F1, with up to 76 micro-average F1 across the emotions joy, annoyance and insecurity. Our findings also indicate that off-the-shelf-tools analyzing face and audio are not ready yet for emotion detection in in-car speech interactions without further adjustments.

## Introduction
Automatic emotion recognition is commonly understood as the task of assigning an emotion to a predefined instance, for example an utterance (as audio signal), an image (for instance with a depicted face), or a textual unit (e.g., a transcribed utterance, a sentence, or a Tweet). The set of emotions is often following the original definition by Ekman Ekman1992, which includes anger, fear, disgust, sadness, joy, and surprise, or the extension by Plutchik Plutchik1980 who adds trust and anticipation.
Most work in emotion detection is limited to one modality. Exceptions include Busso2004 and Sebe2005, who investigate multimodal approaches combining speech with facial information. Emotion recognition in speech can utilize semantic features as well BIBREF0. Note that the term “multimodal” is also used beyond the combination of vision, audio, and text. For example, Soleymani2012 use it to refer to the combination of electroencephalogram, pupillary response and gaze distance.
In this paper, we deal with the specific situation of car environments as a testbed for multimodal emotion recognition. This is an interesting environment since it is, to some degree, a controlled environment: Dialogue partners are limited in movement, the degrees of freedom for occurring events are limited, and several sensors which are useful for emotion recognition are already integrated in this setting. More specifically, we focus on emotion recognition from speech events in a dialogue with a human partner and with an intelligent agent.
Also from the application point of view, the domain is a relevant choice: Past research has shown that emotional intelligence is beneficial for human computer interaction. Properly processing emotions in interactions increases the engagement of users and can improve performance when a specific task is to be fulfilled BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4. This is mostly based on the aspect that machines communicating with humans appear to be more trustworthy when they show empathy and are perceived as being natural BIBREF3, BIBREF5, BIBREF4.
Virtual agents play an increasingly important role in the automotive context and the speech modality is increasingly being used in cars due to its potential to limit distraction. It has been shown that adapting the in-car speech interaction system according to the drivers' emotional state can help to enhance security, performance as well as the overall driving experience BIBREF6, BIBREF7.
With this paper, we investigate how each of the three considered modalitites, namely facial expressions, utterances of a driver as an audio signal, and transcribed text contributes to the task of emotion recognition in in-car speech interactions. We focus on the five emotions of joy, insecurity, annoyance, relaxation, and boredom since terms corresponding to so-called fundamental emotions like fear have been shown to be associated to too strong emotional states than being appropriate for the in-car context BIBREF8. Our first contribution is the description of the experimental setup for our data collection. Aiming to provoke specific emotions with situations which can occur in real-world driving scenarios and to induce speech interactions, the study was conducted in a driving simulator. Based on the collected data, we provide baseline predictions with off-the-shelf tools for face and speech emotion recognition and compare them to a neural network-based approach for emotion recognition from text. Our second contribution is the introduction of transfer learning to adapt models trained on established out-of-domain corpora to our use case. We work on German language, therefore the transfer consists of a domain and a language transfer.

## Related Work ::: Facial Expressions
A common approach to encode emotions for facial expressions is the facial action coding system FACS BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11. As the reliability and reproducability of findings with this method have been critically discussed BIBREF12, the trend has increasingly shifted to perform the recognition directly on images and videos, especially with deep learning. For instance, jung2015joint developed a model which considers temporal geometry features and temporal appearance features from image sequences. kim2016hierarchical propose an ensemble of convolutional neural networks which outperforms isolated networks.
In the automotive domain, FACS is still popular. Ma2017 use support vector machines to distinguish happy, bothered, confused, and concentrated based on data from a natural driving environment. They found that bothered and confused are difficult to distinguish, while happy and concentrated are well identified. Aiming to reduce computational cost, Tews2011 apply a simple feature extraction using four dots in the face defining three facial areas. They analyze the variance of the three facial areas for the recognition of happy, anger and neutral. Ihme2018 aim at detecting frustration in a simulator environment. They induce the emotion with specific scenarios and a demanding secondary task and are able to associate specific face movements according to FACS. Paschero2012 use OpenCV (https://opencv.org/) to detect the eyes and the mouth region and track facial movements. They simulate different lightning conditions and apply a multilayer perceptron for the classification task of Ekman's set of fundamental emotions.
Overall, we found that studies using facial features usually focus on continuous driver monitoring, often in driver-only scenarios. In contrast, our work investigates the potential of emotion recognition during speech interactions.

## Related Work ::: Acoustic
Past research on emotion recognition from acoustics mainly concentrates on either feature selection or the development of appropriate classifiers. rao2013emotion as well as ververidis2004automatic compare local and global features in support vector machines. Next to such discriminative approaches, hidden Markov models are well-studied, however, there is no agreement on which feature-based classifier is most suitable BIBREF13. Similar to the facial expression modality, recent efforts on applying deep learning have been increased for acoustic speech processing. For instance, lee2015high use a recurrent neural network and palaz2015analysis apply a convolutional neural network to the raw speech signal. Neumann2017 as well as Trigeorgis2016 analyze the importance of features in the context of deep learning-based emotion recognition.
In the automotive sector, Boril2011 approach the detection of negative emotional states within interactions between driver and co-driver as well as in calls of the driver towards the automated spoken dialogue system. Using real-world driving data, they find that the combination of acoustic features and their respective Gaussian mixture model scores performs best. Schuller2006 collects 2,000 dialog turns directed towards an automotive user interface and investigate the classification of anger, confusion, and neutral. They show that automatic feature generation and feature selection boost the performance of an SVM-based classifier. Further, they analyze the performance under systematically added noise and develop methods to mitigate negative effects. For more details, we refer the reader to the survey by Schuller2018. In this work, we explore the straight-forward application of domain independent software to an in-car scenario without domain-specific adaptations.

## Related Work ::: Text
Previous work on emotion analysis in natural language processing focuses either on resource creation or on emotion classification for a specific task and domain. On the side of resource creation, the early and influential work of Pennebaker2015 is a dictionary of words being associated with different psychologically relevant categories, including a subset of emotions. Another popular resource is the NRC dictionary by Mohammad2012b. It contains more than 10000 words for a set of discrete emotion classes. Other resources include WordNet Affect BIBREF14 which distinguishes particular word classes. Further, annotated corpora have been created for a set of different domains, for instance fairy tales BIBREF15, Blogs BIBREF16, Twitter BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF21, Facebook BIBREF22, news headlines BIBREF23, dialogues BIBREF24, literature BIBREF25, or self reports on emotion events BIBREF26 (see BIBREF27 for an overview).
To automatically assign emotions to textual units, the application of dictionaries has been a popular approach and still is, particularly in domains without annotated corpora. Another approach to overcome the lack of huge amounts of annotated training data in a particular domain or for a specific topic is to exploit distant supervision: use the signal of occurrences of emoticons or specific hashtags or words to automatically label the data. This is sometimes referred to as self-labeling BIBREF21, BIBREF28, BIBREF29, BIBREF30.
A variety of classification approaches have been tested, including SNoW BIBREF15, support vector machines BIBREF16, maximum entropy classification, long short-term memory network, and convolutional neural network models BIBREF18. More recently, the state of the art is the use of transfer learning from noisy annotations to more specific predictions BIBREF29. Still, it has been shown that transferring from one domain to another is challenging, as the way emotions are expressed varies between areas BIBREF27. The approach by Felbo2017 is different to our work as they use a huge noisy data set for pretraining the model while we use small high quality data sets instead.
Recently, the state of the art has also been pushed forward with a set of shared tasks, in which the participants with top results mostly exploit deep learning methods for prediction based on pretrained structures like embeddings or language models BIBREF21, BIBREF31, BIBREF20.
Our work follows this approach and builds up on embeddings with deep learning. Furthermore, we approach the application and adaption of text-based classifiers to the automotive domain with transfer learning.

## Data set Collection
The first contribution of this paper is the construction of the AMMER data set which we describe in the following. We focus on the drivers' interactions with both a virtual agent as well as a co-driver. To collect the data in a safe and controlled environment and to be able to consider a variety of predefined driving situations, the study was conducted in a driving simulator.

## Data set Collection ::: Study Setup and Design
The study environment consists of a fixed-base driving simulator running Vires's VTD (Virtual Test Drive, v2.2.0) simulation software (https://vires.com/vtd-vires-virtual-test-drive/). The vehicle has an automatic transmission, a steering wheel and gas and brake pedals. We collect data from video, speech and biosignals (Empatica E4 to record heart rate, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, not further used in this paper) and questionnaires. Two RGB cameras are fixed in the vehicle to capture the drivers face, one at the sun shield above the drivers seat and one in the middle of the dashboard. A microphone is placed on the center console. One experimenter sits next to the driver, the other behind the simulator. The virtual agent accompanying the drive is realized as Wizard-of-Oz prototype which enables the experimenter to manually trigger prerecorded voice samples playing trough the in-car speakers and to bring new content to the center screen. Figure FIGREF4 shows the driving simulator.
The experimental setting is comparable to an everyday driving task. Participants are told that the goal of the study is to evaluate and to improve an intelligent driving assistant. To increase the probability of emotions to arise, participants are instructed to reach the destination of the route as fast as possible while following traffic rules and speed limits. They are informed that the time needed for the task would be compared to other participants. The route comprises highways, rural roads, and city streets. A navigation system with voice commands and information on the screen keeps the participants on the predefined track.
To trigger emotion changes in the participant, we use the following events: (i) a car on the right lane cutting off to the left lane when participants try to overtake followed by trucks blocking both lanes with a slow overtaking maneuver (ii) a skateboarder who appears unexpectedly on the street and (iii) participants are praised for reaching the destination unexpectedly quickly in comparison to previous participants.
Based on these events, we trigger three interactions (Table TABREF6 provides examples) with the intelligent agent (Driver-Agent Interactions, D–A). Pretending to be aware of the current situation, e. g., to recognize unusual driving behavior such as strong braking, the agent asks the driver to explain his subjective perception of these events in detail. Additionally, we trigger two more interactions with the intelligent agent at the beginning and at the end of the drive, where participants are asked to describe their mood and thoughts regarding the (upcoming) drive. This results in five interactions between the driver and the virtual agent.
Furthermore, the co-driver asks three different questions during sessions with light traffic and low cognitive demand (Driver-Co-Driver Interactions, D–Co). These questions are more general and non-traffic-related and aim at triggering the participants' memory and fantasy. Participants are asked to describe their last vacation, their dream house and their idea of the perfect job. In sum, there are eight interactions per participant (5 D–A, 3 D–Co).

## Data set Collection ::: Procedure
At the beginning of the study, participants were welcomed and the upcoming study procedure was explained. Subsequently, participants signed a consent form and completed a questionnaire to provide demographic information. After that, the co-driving experimenter started with the instruction in the simulator which was followed by a familiarization drive consisting of highway and city driving and covering different driving maneuvers such as tight corners, lane changing and strong braking. Subsequently, participants started with the main driving task. The drive had a duration of 20 minutes containing the eight previously mentioned speech interactions. After the completion of the drive, the actual goal of improving automatic emotional recognition was revealed and a standard emotional intelligence questionnaire, namely the TEIQue-SF BIBREF32, was handed to the participants. Finally, a retrospective interview was conducted, in which participants were played recordings of their in-car interactions and asked to give discrete (annoyance, insecurity, joy, relaxation, boredom, none, following BIBREF8) was well as dimensional (valence, arousal, dominance BIBREF33 on a 11-point scale) emotion ratings for the interactions and the according situations. We only use the discrete class annotations in this paper.

## Data set Collection ::: Data Analysis
Overall, 36 participants aged 18 to 64 years ($\mu $=28.89, $\sigma $=12.58) completed the experiment. This leads to 288 interactions, 180 between driver and the agent and 108 between driver and co-driver. The emotion self-ratings from the participants yielded 90 utterances labeled with joy, 26 with annoyance, 49 with insecurity, 9 with boredom, 111 with relaxation and 3 with no emotion. One example interaction per interaction type and emotion is shown in Table TABREF7. For further experiments, we only use joy, annoyance/anger, and insecurity/fear due to the small sample size for boredom and no emotion and under the assumption that relaxation brings little expressivity.

## Methods ::: Emotion Recognition from Facial Expressions
We preprocess the visual data by extracting the sequence of images for each interaction from the point where the agent's or the co-driver's question was completely uttered until the driver's response stops. The average length is 16.3 seconds, with the minimum at 2.2s and the maximum at 54.7s. We apply an off-the-shelf tool for emotion recognition (the manufacturer cannot be disclosed due to licensing restrictions). It delivers frame-by-frame scores ($\in [0;100]$) for discrete emotional states of joy, anger and fear. While joy corresponds directly to our annotation, we map anger to our label annoyance and fear to our label insecurity. The maximal average score across all frames constitutes the overall classification for the video sequence. Frames where the software is not able to detect the face are ignored.

## Methods ::: Emotion Recognition from Audio Signal
We extract the audio signal for the same sequence as described for facial expressions and apply an off-the-shelf tool for emotion recognition. The software delivers single classification scores for a set of 24 discrete emotions for the entire utterance. We consider the outputs for the states of joy, anger, and fear, mapping analogously to our classes as for facial expressions. Low-confidence predictions are interpreted as “no emotion”. We accept the emotion with the highest score as the discrete prediction otherwise.

## Methods ::: Emotion Recognition from Transcribed Utterances
For the emotion recognition from text, we manually transcribe all utterances of our AMMER study. To exploit existing and available data sets which are larger than the AMMER data set, we develop a transfer learning approach. We use a neural network with an embedding layer (frozen weights, pre-trained on Common Crawl and Wikipedia BIBREF36), a bidirectional LSTM BIBREF37, and two dense layers followed by a soft max output layer. This setup is inspired by BIBREF38. We use a dropout rate of 0.3 in all layers and optimize with Adam BIBREF39 with a learning rate of $10^{-5}$ (These parameters are the same for all further experiments). We build on top of the Keras library with the TensorFlow backend. We consider this setup our baseline model.
We train models on a variety of corpora, namely the common format published by BIBREF27 of the FigureEight (formally known as Crowdflower) data set of social media, the ISEAR data BIBREF40 (self-reported emotional events), and, the Twitter Emotion Corpus (TEC, weakly annotated Tweets with #anger, #disgust, #fear, #happy, #sadness, and #surprise, Mohammad2012). From all corpora, we use instances with labels fear, anger, or joy. These corpora are English, however, we do predictions on German utterances. Therefore, each corpus is preprocessed to German with Google Translate. We remove URLs, user tags (“@Username”), punctuation and hash signs. The distributions of the data sets are shown in Table TABREF12.
To adapt models trained on these data, we apply transfer learning as follows: The model is first trained until convergence on one out-of-domain corpus (only on classes fear, joy, anger for compatibility reasons). Then, the parameters of the bi-LSTM layer are frozen and the remaining layers are further trained on AMMER. This procedure is illustrated in Figure FIGREF13

## Results ::: Facial Expressions and Audio
Table TABREF16 shows the confusion matrices for facial and audio emotion recognition on our complete AMMER data set and Table TABREF17 shows the results per class for each method, including facial and audio data and micro and macro averages. The classification from facial expressions yields a macro-averaged $\text{F}_1$ score of 33 % across the three emotions joy, insecurity, and annoyance (P=0.31, R=0.35). While the classification results for joy are promising (R=43 %, P=57 %), the distinction of insecurity and annoyance from the other classes appears to be more challenging.
Regarding the audio signal, we observe a macro $\text{F}_1$ score of 29 % (P=42 %, R=22 %). There is a bias towards negative emotions, which results in a small number of detected joy predictions (R=4 %). Insecurity and annoyance are frequently confused.

## Results ::: Text from Transcribed Utterances
The experimental setting for the evaluation of emotion recognition from text is as follows: We evaluate the BiLSTM model in three different experiments: (1) in-domain, (2) out-of-domain and (3) transfer learning. For all experiments we train on the classes anger/annoyance, fear/insecurity and joy. Table TABREF19 shows all results for the comparison of these experimental settings.

## Results ::: Text from Transcribed Utterances ::: Experiment 1: In-Domain application
We first set a baseline by validating our models on established corpora. We train the baseline model on 60 % of each data set listed in Table TABREF12 and evaluate that model with 40 % of the data from the same domain (results shown in the column “In-Domain” in Table TABREF19). Excluding AMMER, we achieve an average micro $\text{F}_1$ of 68 %, with best results of F$_1$=73 % on TEC. The model trained on our AMMER corpus achieves an F1 score of 57%. This is most probably due to the small size of this data set and the class bias towards joy, which makes up more than half of the data set. These results are mostly in line with Bostan2018.

## Results ::: Text from Transcribed Utterances ::: Experiment 2: Simple Out-Of-Domain application
Now we analyze how well the models trained in Experiment 1 perform when applied to our data set. The results are shown in column “Simple” in Table TABREF19. We observe a clear drop in performance, with an average of F$_1$=48 %. The best performing model is again the one trained on TEC, en par with the one trained on the Figure8 data. The model trained on ISEAR performs second best in Experiment 1, it performs worst in Experiment 2.

## Results ::: Text from Transcribed Utterances ::: Experiment 3: Transfer Learning application
To adapt models trained on previously existing data sets to our particular application, the AMMER corpus, we apply transfer learning. Here, we perform leave-one-out cross validation. As pre-trained models we use each model from Experiment 1 and further optimize with the training subset of each crossvalidation iteration of AMMER. The results are shown in the column “Transfer L.” in Table TABREF19. The confusion matrix is also depicted in Table TABREF16.
With this procedure we achieve an average performance of F$_1$=75 %, being better than the results from the in-domain Experiment 1. The best performance of F$_1$=76 % is achieved with the model pre-trained on each data set, except for ISEAR. All transfer learning models clearly outperform their simple out-of-domain counterpart.
To ensure that this performance increase is not only due to the larger data set, we compare these results to training the model without transfer on a corpus consisting of each corpus together with AMMER (again, in leave-one-out crossvalidation). These results are depicted in column “Joint C.”. Thus, both settings, “transfer learning” and “joint corpus” have access to the same information.
The results show an increase in performance in contrast to not using AMMER for training, however, the transfer approach based on partial retraining the model shows a clear improvement for all models (by 7pp for Figure8, 10pp for EmoInt, 8pp for TEC, 13pp for ISEAR) compared to the ”Joint” setup.

## Summary & Future Work
We described the creation of the multimodal AMMER data with emotional speech interactions between a driver and both a virtual agent and a co-driver. We analyzed the modalities of facial expressions, acoustics, and transcribed utterances regarding their potential for emotion recognition during in-car speech interactions. We applied off-the-shelf emotion recognition tools for facial expressions and acoustics. For transcribed text, we developed a neural network-based classifier with transfer learning exploiting existing annotated corpora. We find that analyzing transcribed utterances is most promising for classification of the three emotional states of joy, annoyance and insecurity.
Our results for facial expressions indicate that there is potential for the classification of joy, however, the states of annoyance and insecurity are not well recognized. Future work needs to investigate more sophisticated approaches to map frame predictions to sequence predictions. Furthermore, movements of the mouth region during speech interactions might negatively influence the classification from facial expressions. Therefore, the question remains how facial expressions can best contribute to multimodal detection in speech interactions.
Regarding the classification from the acoustic signal, the application of off-the-shelf classifiers without further adjustments seems to be challenging. We find a strong bias towards negative emotional states for our experimental setting. For instance, the personalization of the recognition algorithm (e. g., mean and standard deviation normalization) could help to adapt the classification for specific speakers and thus to reduce this bias. Further, the acoustic environment in the vehicle interior has special properties and the recognition software might need further adaptations.
Our transfer learning-based text classifier shows considerably better results. This is a substantial result in its own, as only one previous method for transfer learning in emotion recognition has been proposed, in which a sentiment/emotion specific source for labels in pre-training has been used, to the best of our knowledge BIBREF29. Other applications of transfer learning from general language models include BIBREF41, BIBREF42. Our approach is substantially different, not being trained on a huge amount of noisy data, but on smaller out-of-domain sets of higher quality. This result suggests that emotion classification systems which work across domains can be developed with reasonable effort.
For a productive application of emotion detection in the context of speech events we conclude that a deployed system might perform best with a speech-to-text module followed by an analysis of the text. Further, in this work, we did not explore an ensemble model or the interaction of different modalities. Thus, future work should investigate the fusion of multiple modalities in a single classifier.
