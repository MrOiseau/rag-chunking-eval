      "question": "How are EAC evaluated?",
      "free_form_answer": "Qualitatively through efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction aspects and quantitatively through metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, BLEU score and even human judgement.",
      "evidence": [
        "We characterize the evaluation of Emotionally-Aware Chatbot into two different parts, qualitative and quantitative assessment. Qualitative assessment will focus on assessing the functionality of the software, while quantitative more focus on measure the chatbots' performance with a number.",
        "Based on our investigation of several previous studies, we found that most of the works utilized ISO 9241 to assess chatbots' quality by focusing on the usability aspect. This aspect can be grouped into three focuses, including efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction, concerning systems' performance to achieve the specified goals. Here we will explain every focus based on several categories and quality attributes.",
        "In automatic evaluation, some studies focus on evaluating the system at emotion level BIBREF15 , BIBREF28 . Therefore, some common metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy are used to measure system performance, compared to the gold label. This evaluation is similar to emotion classification tasks such as previous SemEval 2018 BIBREF32 and SemEval 2019 . Other studies also proposed to use perplexity to evaluate the model at the content level (to determine whether the content is relevant and grammatical) BIBREF14 , BIBREF39 , BIBREF28 . This evaluation metric is widely used to evaluate dialogue-based systems which rely on probabilistic approach BIBREF61 . Another work by BIBREF14 used BLEU to evaluate the machine response and compare against the gold response (the actual response), although using BLEU to measure conversation generation task is not recommended by BIBREF62 due to its low correlation with human judgment.",
        "This evaluation involves human judgement to measure the chatbots' performance, based on several criteria. BIBREF15 used three annotators to rate chatbots' response in two criteria, content (scale 0,1,2) and emotion (scale 0,1). Content is focused on measuring whether the response is natural acceptable and could plausible produced by a human. This metric measurement is already adopted and recommended by researchers and conversation challenging tasks, as proposed in BIBREF38 . Meanwhile, emotion is defined as whether the emotion expression contained in the response agrees with the given gold emotion category. Similarly, BIBREF28 used four annotators to score the response based on consistency, logic and emotion. Consistency measures the fluency and grammatical aspect of the response. Logic measures the degree whether the post and response logically match. Emotion measures the response, whether it contains the appropriate emotion. All of these aspects were measured by three scales 0, 1, and 2. Meanwhile, BIBREF39 proposed naturalness and emotion impact as criteria to evaluate the chatbots' response. Naturalness evaluates whether the response is intelligible, logically follows the context of the conversation, and acceptable as a human response, while emotion impact measures whether the response elicits a positive emotional or triggers an emotionally-positive dialogue, since their study focus only on positive emotion. Another study by BIBREF14 uses crowdsourcing to gather human judgement based on three aspects of performance including empathy/sympathy - did the responses show understanding of the feelings of the person talking about their experience?; relevance - did the responses seem appropriate to the conversation? Were they on-topic?; and fluency - could you understand the responses? Did the language seem accurate?. All of these aspects recorded with three different response, i.e., (1: not at all, 3: somewhat, 5: very much) from around 100 different annotators. After getting all of the human judgement with different criteria, some of these studies used a t-test to get the statistical significance BIBREF28 , BIBREF39 , while some other used inter-annotator agreement measurement such as Fleiss Kappa BIBREF15 , BIBREF14 . Based on these evaluations, they can compare their system performance with baseline or any other state of the art systems."
