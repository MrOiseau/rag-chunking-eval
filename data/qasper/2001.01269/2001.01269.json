      "free_form_answer": "using word2vec to create features that are used as input to the SVM",
      "evidence": [
        "In a recent work on sentiment analysis in Turkish BIBREF10, they learn embeddings using Turkish social media. They use the word2vec algorithm, create several unsupervised hand-crafted features, generate document vectors and feed them as input into the support vector machines (SVM) approach. We outperform this baseline approach using more effective word embeddings and supervised hand-crafted features."

      "question": "What details are given about the Twitter dataset?",
      "free_form_answer": "one of the Twitter datasets is about Turkish mobile network operators, there are positive, neutral and negative labels and provide the total amount plus the distribution of labels",
      "evidence": [
        "The second Turkish dataset is the Twitter corpus which is formed of tweets about Turkish mobile network operators. Those tweets are mostly much noisier and shorter compared to the reviews in the movie corpus. In total, there are 1,716 tweets. 973 of them are negative and 743 of them are positive. These tweets are manually annotated by two humans, where the labels are either positive or negative. We measured the Cohen's Kappa inter-annotator agreement score to be 0.82. If there was a disagreement on the polarity of a tweet, we removed it.",
        "We also utilised two other datasets in English to test the cross-linguality of our approaches. One of them is a movie corpus collected from the web. There are 5,331 positive reviews and 5,331 negative reviews in this corpus. The other is a Twitter dataset, which has nearly 1.6 million tweets annotated through a distant supervised method BIBREF14. These tweets have positive, neutral, and negative labels. We have selected 7,020 positive tweets and 7,020 negative tweets randomly to generate a balanced dataset."

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them."
