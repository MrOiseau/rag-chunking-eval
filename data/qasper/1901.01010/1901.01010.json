        "We proposed to use visual renderings of documents to capture implicit document quality indicators, such as font choices, images, and visual layout, which are not captured in textual content. We applied neural network models to capture visual features given visual renderings of documents. Experimental results show that we achieve a 2.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art approaches based on textual features over Wikipedia, and performance competitive with or surpassing state-of-the-art approaches over arXiv. We further proposed a joint model, combining textual and visual representations, to predict the quality of a document. Experimental results show that our joint model outperforms the visual-only model in all cases, and the text-only model on Wikipedia and two subsets of arXiv. These results underline the feasibility of assessing document quality via visual features, and the complementarity of visual and textual document representations for quality assessment."

        "The Wikipedia dataset consists of articles from English Wikipedia, with quality class labels assigned by the Wikipedia community. Wikipedia articles are labelled with one of six quality classes, in descending order of quality: Featured Article (\u201cFA\u201d), Good Article (\u201cGA\u201d), B-class Article (\u201cB\u201d), C-class Article (\u201cC\u201d), Start Article (\u201cStart\u201d), and Stub Article (\u201cStub\u201d). A description of the criteria associated with the different classes can be found in the Wikipedia grading scheme page. The quality class of a Wikipedia article is assigned by Wikipedia reviewers or any registered user, who can discuss through the article's talk page to reach consensus. We constructed the dataset by first crawling all articles from each quality class repository, e.g., we get FA articles by crawling pages from the FA repository: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Featured_articles. This resulted in around 5K FA, 28K GA, 212K B, 533K C, 2.6M Start, and 3.2M Stub articles.",
        "The arXiv dataset BIBREF2 consists of three subsets of academic articles under the arXiv repository of Computer Science (cs), from the three subject areas of: Artificial Intelligence (cs.ai), Computation and Language (cs.cl), and Machine Learning (cs.lg). In line with the original dataset formulation BIBREF2 , a paper is considered to have been accepted (i.e. is positively labeled) if it matches a paper in the DBLP database or is otherwise accepted by any of the following conferences: ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL, TACL, NIPS, ICML, ICLR, or AAAI. Failing this, it is considered to be rejected (noting that some of the papers may not have been submitted to one of these conferences). The median numbers of pages for papers in cs.ai, cs.cl, and cs.lg are 11, 10, and 12, respectively. To make sure each page in the PDF file has the same size in the screenshot, we crop the PDF file of a paper to the first 12; we pad the PDF file with blank pages if a PDF file has less than 12 pages, using the PyPDF2 Python package. We then use ImageMagick to convert the 12-page PDF file to a single 1,000 $\\times $ 2,000 pixel screenshot. Table 2 details this dataset, where the \u201cAccepted\u201d column denotes the percentage of positive instances (accepted papers) in each subset."
