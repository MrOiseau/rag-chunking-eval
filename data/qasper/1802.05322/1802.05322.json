The inspiration for the first model comes from BIBREF1 in their paper DBLP:journals/corr/cmp-lg-9707002 where they used an MLP for text genre detection. The model used in this paper comes from scikit-learn's neural_network module and is called MLPClassifier. Table TABREF35 shows all parameters that were changed from the default values."
