        "We review the main differences between Wikidata and static knowledge bases extracted from Wikipedia, and analyze their implactions for entity linking. We illustrate these differences by building a simple entity linker, OpenTapioca, which only uses data from Wikidata, and show that it is competitive with other systems with access to larger data sources for some tasks. OpenTapioca can be trained easily from a Wikidata dump only, and can be efficiently kept up to date in real time as Wikidata evolves. We also propose tools to adapt existing entity linking datasets to Wikidata, and offer a new entity linking dataset, consisting of affiliation strings extracted from research articles."
