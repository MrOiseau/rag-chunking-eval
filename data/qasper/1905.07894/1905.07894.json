        "In this paper, based on the assumption that the interactions between users and the content of the exchanged messages convey different information, we propose a new method to perform abuse detection while leveraging both sources. For this purpose, we take advantage of the content- BIBREF14 and graph-based BIBREF10 methods that we previously developed. We propose three different ways to combine them, and compare their performance on a corpus of chat logs originating from the community of a French multiplayer online game. We then perform a feature study, finding the most informative ones and discussing their role. Our contribution is twofold: the exploration of fusion methods, and more importantly the identification of discriminative features for this problem."
