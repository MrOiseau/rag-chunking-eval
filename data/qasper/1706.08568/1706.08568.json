For factoid questions, the system's responses are interpreted as a ranked list of answer candidates. They are evaluated using mean-reciprocal rank (MRR). For list questions, the system's responses are interpreted as a set of answers to the list question. Precision and recall are computed by comparing the given answers to the gold-standard answers. F1 score, i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is used as the official evaluation measure ."
