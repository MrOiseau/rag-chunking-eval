        "Split the data into train, development and test corpus: for each languages, we provide training data of different sizes (1k, 2k, 5k and 10k stories), a development (1k) and a test corpus (4k);",
        "Most works in the literature use only 1 000 examples to train the document classifier. To invest the impact of more training data, we also provide training corpora of 2 000, 5 000 and 10 000 documents. The development corpus for each language is composed of 1 000 and the test set of 4 000 documents respectively. All have uniform class distributions. An important aspect of this work is to provide a framework to study and evaluate cross-lingual document classification for many language pairs. In that spirit, we will name this corpus \u201cMultilingual Document Classification Corpus\u201d, abbreviated as MLDoc. The full Reuters Corpus Volume 2 has a special license and we can not distribute it ourselves. Instead, we provide tools to extract all the subsets of MLDoc at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MLDoc.",
        "We have defined a new evaluation framework for cross-lingual document classification in eight languages. This corpus largely extends previous corpora which were also based on the Reuters Corpus Volume 2, but mainly considered the transfer between English and German. We also provide detailed baseline results using two competitive approaches (multilingual word and sentence embeddings, respectively), for cross-lingual document classification between all eight languages. This new evaluation framework is freely available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MLDoc."
