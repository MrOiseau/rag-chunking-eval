      "free_form_answer": "1 IMDB dataset and 2 Yelp datasets",
      "evidence": [
        "We construct three datasets based on IMDB reviews and Yelp reviews. The IMDB dataset is binarised and split into a training and test set, each with 25K reviews (2K reviews from the training set are reserved for development). We filter out any review that has more than 400 tokens, producing the final dataset (imdb400). For Yelp, we binarise the ratings, and create 2 datasets, where we keep only reviews with $\\le $ 50 tokens (yelp50) and $\\le $200 tokens (yelp200). We randomly partition both datasets into train/dev/test sets (90/5/5 for yelp50; 99/0.5/0.5 for yelp200). For all datasets, we use spaCy for tokenisation. We train and tune target classifiers (see Section SECREF8) using the training and development sets; and evaluate their performance on the original examples in the test sets as well as the adversarial examples generated by attacking methods for the test sets. Note that AutoEncoder also involves a training process, for which we train and tune AutoEncoder using the training and development sets in yelp50, yelp200 and imdb400. Statistics of the three datasets are presented in Table TABREF22. These datasets present a variation in the text lengths (e.g. the average number of words for yelp50, yelp200 and imdb400 is 34, 82 and 195 words respectively), training data size (e.g. the number of training examples for target classifiers for imdb400, yelp50 and yelp200 are 18K, 407K and 2M, respectively) and input domain (e.g. restaurant vs. movie reviews)."
