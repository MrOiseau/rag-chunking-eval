      "question": "What sources of less sensitive data are available?",
      "free_form_answer": "MIMICII(I), THYME, results from i2b2 and ShARe/CLEF shared task, MiPACQ, Blulab, EMC Dutch Clinical Corpus, 2010 i2b2/VA, VetCompass",
      "evidence": [
        "Because of legal and institutional concerns arising from the sensitivity of clinical data, it is difficult for the NLP community to gain access to relevant data BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 . This is especially true for the researchers not connected with a healthcare organization. Corpora with transparent access policies that are within reach of NLP researchers exist, but are few. An often used corpus is MIMICII(I) BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 . Despite its large size (covering over 58,000 hospital admissions), it is only representative of patients from a particular clinical domain (the intensive care in this case) and geographic location (a single hospital in the United States). Assuming that such a specific sample is representative of a larger population is an example of sampling bias (we discuss further sources of bias in section \"Social impact and biases\" ). Increasing the size of a sample without recognizing that this sample is atypical for the general population (e.g. not all patients are critical care patients) could also increase sampling bias BIBREF13 . We need more large corpora for various medical specialties, narrative types, as well as languages and geographic areas.",
        "Related to difficult access to raw clinical data is the lack of available annotated datasets for model training and benchmarking. The reality is that annotation projects do take place, but are typically constrained to a single healthcare organization. Therefore, much of the effort put into annotation is lost afterwards due to impossibility of sharing with the larger research community BIBREF6 , BIBREF14 . Again, exceptions are either few\u2014e.g. THYME BIBREF15 , a corpus annotated with temporal information\u2014or consist of small datasets resulting from shared tasks like the i2b2 and ShARe/CLEF. In addition, stringent access policies hamper reproduction efforts, impede scientific oversight and limit collaboration, not only between institutions but also more broadly between the clinical and NLP communities.",
        "There are known cases of datasets that had been used in published research (including reproduction) in its full form, like MiPACQ, Blulab, EMC Dutch Clinical Corpus and 2010 i2b2/VA BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , but were later trimmed down or made unavailable, likely due to legal issues. Even if these datasets were still available in full, their small size is still a concern, and the comments above regarding sampling bias certainly apply. For example, a named entity recognizer trained on 2010 i2b2/VA data, which consists of 841 annotated patient records from three different specialty areas, will due to its size only contain a small portion of possible named entities. Similarly, in linking clinical concepts to an ontology, where the number of output classes is larger BIBREF20 , the small amount of training data is a major obstacle to deployment of systems suitable for general use.",
        "Finally, clinical NLP is also possible on veterinary texts. Records of companion animals are perhaps less likely to involve legal issues, while still amounting to a large pool of data. As an example, around 40M clinical documents from different veterinary clinics in UK and Australia are stored centrally in the VetCompass repository. First NLP steps in this direction were described in the invited talk at the Clinical NLP 2016 workshop BIBREF43 ."

      "question": "Other than privacy, what are the other major ethical challenges in clinical data?",

        "Unlocking knowledge from free text in the health domain has a tremendous societal value. However, discrimination can occur when individuals or groups receive unfair treatment as a result of automated processing, which might be a result of biases in the data that were used to train models. The question is therefore what the most important biases are and how to overcome them, not only out of ethical but also legal responsibility. Related to the question of bias is so-called algorithm transparency BIBREF44 , BIBREF45 , as this right to explanation requires that influences of bias in training data are charted. In addition to sampling bias, which we introduced in section 2, we discuss in this section further sources of bias. Unlike sampling bias, which is a corpus-level bias, these biases here are already present in documents, and therefore hard to account for by introducing larger corpora.",
        "paragraph4 0.9ex plus1ex minus.2ex-1em Data quality Texts produced in the clinical settings do not always tell a complete or accurate patient story (e.g. due to time constraints or due to patient treatment in different hospitals), yet important decisions can be based on them. As language is situated, a lot of information may be implicit, such as the circumstances in which treatment decisions are made BIBREF47 . If we fail to detect a medical concept during automated processing, this can not necessarily be a sign of negative evidence. Work on identifying and imputing missing values holds promise for reducing incompleteness, see Lipton et al. LiptonEtAl2016 for an example in sequential modeling applied to diagnosis classification.",
        "We need to be aware that clinical notes may reflect health disparities. These can originate from prejudices held by healthcare practitioners which may impact patients' perceptions; they can also originate from communication difficulties in the case of ethnic differences BIBREF49 . Finally, societal norms can play a role. Brady et al. BradyEtAl2016 find that obesity is often not documented equally well for both sexes in weight-addressing clinics. Young males are less likely to be recognized as obese, possibly due to societal norms seeing them as \u201cstocky\" as opposed to obese. Unless we are aware of such bias, we may draw premature conclusions about the impact of our results."
